# What is the issue in giving credit card for freemium hosting services?

Ideally they don't need credit card for providing freemium services. Lets understand why the providers require credit card

## Why provider require credit card for freemium services?

- Ensuring they are giving service to a potential future customer. They don't consider someone not having credit card as potential customer.
- The freemium service is not being misused. In case any enquiry happens service provider can easily track the customer details using credit card.

## Whats the problem

It is the unexpected surge in usage that results in huge bills. Below are some scenarios.

- In case of an DDoS attack on the Function or exposed end point, service provider can charge.
- In case our service got popular and many other start using from their own applications, we may get a bill.

We can argue that it was an attack and the provider my reimburse us. But that may take 8 hours call with support desk and another 4 hours with escalation. It may take weeks or months to get approved. 

Why take risk if it is ok to go down in case of over usage?

## Alternative

Some freemium cloud providers ensure that they will only charge if we authorize them in addition to adding credit card. They just keep the credit card details for verification. In case of DDoS, it just act as true freemium and the service will be unavailable than producing a huge bill.

Still we need to monitor the cloud provider's agreement and changes. There can be provision for them to change the terms and conditions and start charging without our authorization.
